{"lyrics":"There's a lady who's sure\r\nAll that glitters is gold\r\nAnd she's buying a stairway to heaven.\r\nWhen she gets there she knows\r\nIf the stores are all closed\r\nWith a word she can get what she came for.\n\nOoh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to heaven.\n\nThere's a sign on the wall\n\nBut she wants to be sure\n\n'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings.\n\nIn a tree by the brook\n\nThere's a songbird who sings,\n\nSometimes all of our thoughts
are misgiven.\n\nOoh, it makes me wonder,\n\nOoh, it makes me wonder.\n\nThere's a feeling I get\n\nWhen I look to the west,\n\nAnd my spirit is crying for leaving.\n\nIn my thoughts I have
seen\n\nRings of smoke through the trees,\n\nAnd the voices of those who stand looking.\n\nOoh, it makes me wonder,\n\nOoh, it really makes me wonder.\n\nAnd it's whispered that soon, If we
all call the tune\n\nThen the piper will lead us to reason.\n\nAnd a new day will dawn\n\nFor those who stand long\n\nAnd the forests will echo with laughter.\n\nIf there's a bustle in your
hedgerow, don't be alarmed now\n\nIt's just a spring clean for the May queen.\n\nYes, there are two paths you can go by\n\nBut in the long run\n\nThere's still time to change the road you're on.\n\nAnd it makes me wonder.\n\nYour head is humming and it won't go\n\nIn case you don't know,\n\nThe piper's calling you to join him,\n\nDear lady, can you hear the wind blow,\n\nAnd did you know\n\nYour stairway lies on the whispering wind.\n\nAnd as we wind on down the road\n\nOur shadows taller than our soul.\n\nThere walks a lady we all know\n\nWho shines white light and wants to show\n\nHow ev'rything still turns to gold.\n\nAnd if you listen very hard\n\nThe tune will come to you at last.\n\nWhen all are one and one is all\n\nTo be a rock and not to roll.\n\nAnd she's buying a stairway to heaven"}
